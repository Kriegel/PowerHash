# PowerHash
Module to hash (checksum) files and Bytearrays  to compare files, check integrity and find duplicates

This is currently in beta / Testing stage!

This Module is using the [non-cryptographic hash functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions#Non-cryptographic_hash_functions) out of the following C# Project
https://github.com/brandondahler/Data.HashFunction

I recommend to use xxHash (32 0r 64) for VERY Fast checksums
